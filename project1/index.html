      This project must be written in C and must compile (with gcc)
      and run on one of the iMacs in the Vertica Lounge. (<a
      href="http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~guru/public_work_stations.html">click
      here for a list of available machines</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      You must include a Makefile for compiling from the command line
      (you are free to use an IDE during development but your grader
      will expect to type `make tcpproxy` to build your project).
    </p>
    <p>
      Also you must include a README file that contains a description of your implementation 
      and any issues your code might have. This is an individual project and all 
      submitted work must be your own. To this effect, to receive any credit, you will
      have to include in your README a statement, attesting the submitted work is yours. 
      So while you are allowed to discuss your solution with other students, 
      make sure you do not share your code. If you have extensive discussions with another 
      student, please indicate this in your README file.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    The project this semester will be the design, development, and
    performance testing of a proxy server. We will accomplish this
    in multiple stages (called <strong>milestones</strong>). In this
    first milestone, you will implement a simple, single-threaded
    server that can proxy any TCP/IP communication from one remote
    client to one remote host/server. You will use non-blocking socket
    communication and the basic C skills described in the tutorial.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your TCP proxy server will allow remote clients to communicate with a
    single remote host/server as though the proxy server were that
    server. Sometimes this can be used to get around security
    restrictions (since it can make a client appear to originate from
    a different network). There are less nefarious uses for proxy servers like caching server
    responses to improve performance, but for now we will just discuss
    the technical details of what it means to be a proxy server.
  </p>

  <p>
    Say that a client on remote host <b>C</b> wants to communicate
    with a server on remote host <b>S</b>. Once a TCP socket
    is established between <b>C</b> and <b>S</b>, <b>C</b> can send
    requests to <b>S</b>, and <b>S</b> can respond. The communication
    channel is bidirectional, meaning that both hosts can be sending
    at the same time.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:center"><img src="client2server.png" /></p>

  <p>
    The introduction of a TCP proxy server <b>P</b> that is configured to act as
    a proxy for <b>S</b> means that <b>C</b> can communicate with <b>S</b>
    <em>by connecting to <b>P</b></em>. <b>S</b> will think that it is
    communicating with <b>P</b>, effectively hiding the existence of
    <b>C</b>.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:center"><img src="client2proxy.png" /></p>

  <p>
    This also hides the existence of the server from the client, and
    so this kind of proxy is sometimes used as a sort of gateway
    between clients outside a network and servers inside the network.
  </p>

  <h2>Basic Requirements</h2>

  <h3>Non-blocking operation</h3>

  <p>
    Your proxy server (P above) must avoid blocking on a socket which will not
    produce output. This means that you must check both the client and
    server sockets for their ready state before attempting a <span
    class="code">read</span> or <span class="code">write</span>.
  </p>

  <h3>Memory consumption</h3>

  <p>
    Your proxy server must use fixed-size buffers between the client
    and server. This means that your server can proxy requests and
    responses of any size without consuming unbounded resources on the
    machine where the server is running.
  </p>

  <h3>Serving clients</h3>

  <p>
    Your proxy server will serve only one client at a time. 
    An industrial strength proxy server needs to serve an
    arbitrary number of simultaneous clients. 
    You may want to consider what would it take to do this.
  </p>

  <h3>Invoking your TCP proxy server</h3>

  <p>
    Your proxy program should be called <strong
    class="code">tcpproxy</strong>. It should accept the following
    positional arguments on the command line when it is invoked:
  </p>

  <ol class="code">
    <li>remote_host</li>
    <li>remote_port</li>
    <li>proxy_server_port</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Your proxy server will listen for incoming connections from clients on <span
    class="code">proxy_server_port</span>. After accepting a new client,
    your proxy server will open a new connection to <span
    class="code">remote_host</span> using <span
    class="code">remote_port</span>, and proxy communications between
    the remote host and remote client.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is an example of invoking <strong
    class="code">tcpproxy</strong> to listen for incoming clients on
    port <span class="code">8000</span> and to proxy those clients to
    the web server <span class="code">www.brandeis.edu</span> over
    port <span class="code">80</span> (the standard <span
    class="code">HTTP</span> port):
  </p>

  <pre class="command">./tcpproxy www.brandeis.edu 80 8000</pre>

  <p style="text-align:center"><img src="example.png" /></p>

  <p>
    When invoked with no arguments or incorrect arguments, <strong
    class="code">tcpproxy</strong> should output usage instructions:
  </p>

  <pre class="output">Usage: tcpproxy remote_host remote_port proxy_server_port</pre>

  <h2>Design</h2>

  <h3>Proxy Server loop design</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Open a socket which listens for new connections</li>
    <li>In an infinite loop, accept incoming client connections</li>
    <li>When a new client arrives, open a <em>new</em> connection to the remote host</li>
    <li>Proxy between the remote client and remote host until they terminate their connections</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Short writes</h3>

  <p>
    When you attempt to <span class="code">read</span> from a socket
    into a buffer, or <span class="code">write</span> from a buffer
    into a socket, the operating system may not read or write all the
    bytes you requested. This often happens with <span
    class="code">read</span>, because there may simply not be enough
    data left in server's response to fill up the entire buffer you
    provided. However, it can <em>also</em> happen with <span
    class="code">write</span>! When the operating system writes fewer
    bytes than you requested, it is called a <em>short write</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can detect a short write by comparing the number of bytes
    written by <span class="code">write</span> to the number of bytes
    you requested to be written. The number of bytes actually written
    is the return value from write. The following code can detect both
    errors and short writes (but doesn't tell you what to do with
    them!)
  </p>

  <pre class="code">if((n = write(fd, buf, used)) &lt; 0) {
    // error!
} else if(n &lt; used) {
    // the operating system couldn't write all the bytes we asked it to!
}</pre>

  <p>
    It is up to you to figure out how to solve the short writes problem.
  </p>

  <h3>Asynchronous I/O</h3>

  <p>
    The remote client and remote server of your TCP proxy server may at some
    point itself block, waiting for data from the other remote
    host. Since your TCP proxy server does not have knowledge of the
    application-level protocol being followed by the remote hosts, it
    is possible for a <span class="code">read</span> from one of the
    hosts to block indefinitely (if that host is itself waiting for
    more data before it sends again). Using asynchronous I/O solves
    this problem, because it allows your proxy server to read and write from
    ready sockets, and to only block when there is no I/O to do.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will use <strong class="code">select</strong> or <strong
    class="code">poll</strong> to accomplish asynchrony. A
    comprehensive discussion of <strong class="code">select</strong>
    is given in <a
    href="http://pages.cs.brandeis.edu/~cs146a/tutorials/net2.pdf">this
    handout</a>. You can also read how to use them in their respective
    man pages (<span class="command">man 2 select</span> and <span
    class="command">man 2 poll</span>).
  </p>

  <p>
    We recommend you use <span class="code">select</span> unless you
    are familiar with how to read and understand APIs, since you have
    more documentation on <span class="code">select</span> at your
    disposal. The benefit of using <span class="code">poll</span>, if
    you choose to use it, is that it has a slightly more convenient and
    efficient interface for this particular problem (non-blocking I/O
    with a small number of sockets).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The purpose of <span class="code">select</span> and <span
    class="code">poll</span> is to block until at least one of a set
    of sockets (represented by file descriptors) is ready for
    I/O. Once at least one socket is ready, you are given a data
    structure to search that tells you which sockets are ready. You
    can then perform <span class="code">read</span> and <span
    class="code">write</span> without the danger of blocking
    indefinitely.
  </p>

  <h3>Managing buffers</h3>

  <p>
    You must use fixed-size buffers for proxying between the two
    remote hosts. This means that you cannot necessarily allocate a
    buffer that is large enough to hold an entire request or
    response. Also, if one of the remote hosts (either the client or
    the server) is significantly faster than the other remote host,
    then you may run into a situation where you need to write into a
    buffer that is still partially-filled from a previous read (i.e.,
    because of short writes).
  </p>

  <p>
    One way for your proxy server to handle this is to read from one host
    (host A) into a buffer, then write the entirety of that buffer to
    the other host (host B) before reading again from host A (taking
    care to handle short writes appropriately). This approach is
    acceptable for this milestone.
  </p>

  <p>
    The way this problem is often solved in industrial strength code
    is to use a <a
    href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Circular_buffer">circular
    buffer</a> (also called a &quot;ring buffer&quot;). In a circular
    buffer, you can call read from the head of the buffer and write to
    the tail of the buffer, wrapping around the edges of the memory
    allocated to the buffer as though it were a single continuous
    ring. This greatly simplifies the process of managing the buffer
    space. However, circular buffers are very tricky to implement and
    test. This project does not require a circular buffer; but, a
    future project might. So, if you want to try
     implementing a circular buffer you can get feedback on it as
    part of this project.

  </ul>

  <h3>Making sockets asynchronous</h3>

  <p>
    Here is a sample function to make any open socket ready for
    asynchronous I/O (you need to call this on sockets you want to use
    with <span class="code">select</span> or <span
    class="code">poll</span>):
  </p>

  <pre class="code">int make_async(int s) {
    int n;

    if((n = fcntl(s, F_GETFL)) == -1 || fcntl(s, F_SETFL, n | O_NONBLOCK) == -1)
        perr("fcntl");
    n = 1;
    if(setsockopt(s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_KEEPALIVE, &amp;n, sizeof(n)) == -1)
        perr("setsockopt");

    return 0;
  err:
    return -1;
}</pre>

  <h3><span class="code">select</span> and <span class="code">poll</span></h3>

  <p>
    To call <span class="code">select</span>, you initialize two <span
    class="code">fd_set</span>s which list the sockets that you would
    like to read from or write to, and then loop over those arrays to
    find sockets which are ready for reading or writing. Essentially,
    you specify <em>intent</em> in the input arrays, and <span
    class="code">select</span> updates those arrays with socket ready
    states. You will want to adapt the following code into a utility
    library to make managing asynchrony easy (use this for
    inspiration, don't copy and paste it into your program).
  </p>

  <pre class="code">int fd, n_ready;
fd_set r_ready, w_ready;
FD_ZERO(&amp;r_ready);
FD_ZERO(&amp;w_ready);

// Set intent to read and write for the remote client and remote server
// if and only if you have data to write or free space in a buffer into
// which to read. If your program doesn't intend to do a particular I/O
// with a socket, don't FD_SET that intent in r_ready or w_ready.
//
if(space_in_remote_client_read_buffer)
    FD_SET(remote_client, &amp;r_ready);
if(data_in_remote_client_write_buffer)
    FD_SET(remote_client, &amp;w_ready);
if(space_in_remote_server_read_buffer)
    FD_SET(remote_server, &amp;r_ready);
if(data_in_remote_server_write_buffer)
    FD_SET(remote_server, &amp;w_ready);

// select will block until at least one socket is ready.
//
if((n_ready = select(FD_SETSIZE, &amp;r_ready, &amp;w_ready, NULL, NULL)) &lt; 0)
    pdie("select");

// Loop over r_ready and w_ready to see which clients are ready for I/O
// n_ready is set to the total number of reads and writes the sockets
// are ready for, so we decrement it every time we find a ready socket,
// and terminate the loop once we have handled all ready sockets.
//
for(fd = 0; n_ready > 0 &amp;&amp; fd &lt; FD_SETSIZE; ++fd) {
    if(FD_ISSET(fd, &amp;r_ready)) {
        --n_ready;

        // do the read
    }
    if(FD_ISSET(fd, &amp;w_ready)) {
        --n_ready;

        // do the write
    }
}</pre>

  <p>
    poll can be a little more efficient in this case because we can
    ask it to check only two file descriptors, instead of an entire
    fd_set. The basic recipe is like this (again, use this for
    inspiration, don't copy and paste it into your program):
  </p>

  <pre class="code">
struct pollfd pollfds[2];
pollfds[0].fd = remote_client;
pollfds[0].events = pollfds[0].revents = 0;
pollfds[1].fd = remote_server;
pollfds[1].events = pollfds[1].revents = 0;

// Set intent in the events member of each pollfd struct
//
if(space_in_remote_client_read_buffer)
    pollfds[0].events |= POLLIN;
if(data_in_remote_client_write_buffer)
    pollfds[0].events |= POLLOUT;
if(space_in_remote_server_read_buffer)
    pollfds[1].events |= POLLIN;
if(data_in_remote_server_write_buffer)
    pollfds[1].events |= POLLOUT;

if(poll(pollfds, 2, -1) < 0)
    pdie("poll");

// Read the ready state in the revents member of each pollfd struct
//
if(pollfds[0].revents &amp; POLLIN) {
    // do the read from the remote client
}
if(pollfds[0].revents &amp; POLLOUT) {
    // do the write to the remote client
}
if(pollfds[1].revents &amp; POLLIN) {
    // do the read from the remote server
}
if(pollfds[1].revents &amp; POLLOUT) {
    // do the write to th remote server
}
</pre>

  <p>
    You can probably think of more elegant ways to do either the
    select or poll loops. Please do your best to design an elegant,
    modular solution that avoids duplicating code and makes testing
    easy. This is one of the most important practical skills to work
    on as a systems developer.
  </p>

  <h2>Testing</h2>

  <p>
    Please remember to test you solution on one of the iMacs in the Vertica Lounge before you submit.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should be able to access a web page through your proxy server. To
    test this at the command line, invoke <span
    class="command">tcpproxy</span> to proxy the Brandeis web
    server:
  </p>

  <pre class="command">./tcpproxy www.brandeis.edu 80 8000</pre>

  <p>
    Then, in another terminal window, use telnet to request the
    homepage (notice that we telnet to the proxy host and port, not
    directly to theBrandeis web server):
  </p>

  <pre class="command">telnet localhost 8000
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /

</pre>

  <p>
    You should also test with some binary data. An image is a good
    choice. Keep your proxy running. Find an image on the CS
    department homepage, maybe this one:
  </p>

  <pre class="code">http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/wp-content/themes/twentyten/images/headers/path.jpg</pre>

  <p>
    Then replace the hostname with &quot;localhost:8000&quot; to use
    your TCP proxy server instead. Firefox should still be able to load the
    image, but this time through your proxy instead of directly from
    the department's web server.
  </p>

  <pre class="code">http://localhost:8000/wp-content/themes/twentyten/images/headers/path.jpg</pre>

  <p>
    Some websites may not work correctly if accessed using your web
    browser through your TCP proxy server. This is because your web browser
    puts the name of the server it is communicating with in HTTP
    requests, and some web servers use that host name to figure out
    which web site the client is accessing (servers that use this are
    employing what's called named-based virtual hosts). You should at
    least be able to read HTML files via HTTP/0.9 using telnet and
    images by directly accessing them by filename in your web
    browser.
